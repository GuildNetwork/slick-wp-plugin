Increase pageviews and delight visitors with fast and responsive site search, beautiful content discovery tools and more.

== Description ==

Slickstream is a startup with a simple mission: To help publishers create exceptional user experiences and maximize their visitor engagement.

This plugin is for users of the [Slickstream Engagement Suite](https://www.slickstream.com/engagement-suite) â€” it adds our embed code to your pages and registers tools that you can place anywhere on your pages. These tools provide visitors with a simple interactive way to see all of the content available on your site in a highly engaging way. We use contextual information to maximize the likelihood that a visitor will see another page that will interest them.

You have several tools and options to choose from, including Responsive Search, Filmstrips, User Favorites and Games. For more information, or to sign up for our 30-day free trial, visit us at [slickstream.com](https://slickstream.com).
